While the determinants of the erosion of democracy have been extensively scrutinized in the literature, their public policy consequences remain relatively unexplored. In a novel attempt to navigate this uncharted terrain, we analyze the effect of autocratization on health outcomes. We conceptualize autocratization as the relative decline of ‚Äòvertical‚Äô and ‚Äòhorizontal‚Äô accountability. ‚ÄòVertical accountability‚Äô is threatened in the absence of regular free and fair elections as well as restricted political participation. A decline in vertical accountability lowers citizens‚Äô capacity to ensure governmental responsiveness to public demands. ‚ÄòHorizontal accountability‚Äô is reduced when the executive branch undermines the other branches of government. Limited electoral competition further strengthens the executive branch relative to other branches. We argue that such a movement away from emocracy‚Äîautocratization‚Äîhas a detrimental effect on public health outcomes. We present empirical evidence supporting this argument in within- and cross-country contexts using regression discontinuity designs as well as panel data analysis.","tags":null,"title":"The Health Cost of Autocratization","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Byunghwan Son","Chungshik Moon"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1630368000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1630368000,"objectID":"ece362a87b9000bf478e8ceaff75e500","permalink":"https://academic-demo.netlify.app/publication/son2021b/","publishdate":"2021-08-31T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/son2021b/","section":"publication","summary":"Do external security threats shy away from foreign investors?

We contend that 1) foreign investors favor conservative over liberal governments, and 2) investors have learned over time that North Korean threats lead to electoral gains for the conservative party. Our time-series analysis of the monthly Korean stock market data in the post-liberalization period (2000‚Äì2018) reveals that North Korean threats led to increases in capital inflows if these threats were made under liberal governments or in the period prior to parliamentary elections.","tags":null,"title":"Security Threats and Investment: North Korean Threats and the South Korean Stock Market","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Byunghwan Son"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1629072000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1629072000,"objectID":"cc50950a6c4c71d2a2b6a1a77e6547de","permalink":"https://academic-demo.netlify.app/publication/son2021a/","publishdate":"2021-08-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/son2021a/","section":"publication","summary":"Do presidential approval ratings affect exchange rates?

But the empirical domain of this literature has been confined largely to American foreign policy and whether and how this empirical regularity holds in a non-democratic, non-western setting is unknown. Filling this lacuna, this research note studies the Vietnamese public attitudes toward Chinese economic expansion. I argue that Vietnamese citizens who grew up amid Doi Moi (renovation) had a political socialization experience very different from that of the birth cohorts who immediately preceded them. I demonstrate that the traditional ‚Äòsocialist brotherhood‚Äô rhetoric that used to moderate otherwise hostile public opinions about China became insignificant through the course of the reform. This abrupt change led to markedly divergent views between the pre- and post-Doi Moi birth groups on China. Using the data from the latest Pew Global Attitude Survey, I demonstrate that Doi Moi increased the Vietnamese public's negative perception of Chinese economic expansion.","tags":null,"title":"Doi Moi and Vietnamese threat perception of Chinese economic growth","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Byunghwan Son"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1596067200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1596067200,"objectID":"ad488e030ac20da2d6211bf40c90e77a","permalink":"https://academic-demo.netlify.app/publication/son2020b/","publishdate":"2020-07-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/son2020b/","section":"publication","summary":"How do ordinary citizens view labor unions? The importance of public opinion about unions has rarely been highlighted in the contemporary literature on labor politics. Using five waves of the World Value Surveys on South Korea, this article suggests that public confidence in labor unions is significantly affected by individuals‚Äô interpersonal trust, conditional on their perception of the political representation of labor. Unlike those with high levels of trust, low-trust individuals view unions as an agent seeking their exclusionary interests at the expense of the rest of the society. The difference between high- and low-trust individuals‚Äô confidence in labor unions is more pronounced when a liberal, rather than a conservative, government is in power because of the public perception that labor interests are already well-represented by the liberal government and union functions are redundant in such a circumstances. The empirical findings are found robust to alternative theoretical arguments and empirical techniques.","tags":null,"title":"Interpersonal Trust and Confidence in Labor Unions: The Case of South Korea","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Byunghwan Son"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1593561600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1593561600,"objectID":"bb8d696e6812433008274faa96b32a57","permalink":"https://academic-demo.netlify.app/publication/son2020a/","publishdate":"2020-07-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/son2020a/","section":"publication","summary":"Does democracy affect foreign exchange reserves? This paper identifies four possible explanations for the determinants of foreign exchange reserves. Using the relationship between public goods provision and political regime types as a conceptual centerpiece, it offers a theoretical framework in which these four arguments are pit against each other. The ‚Äúinsurance‚Äù and ‚Äúsocial cost‚Äù arguments posit monotonously positive and negative relationships between democracy and reserves, respectively, each citing democratic governments‚Äô propensity to provide public goods such as financial stability and public spending. The mercantilist and rentier state arguments together put forth a conditional hypothesis that autocracies serve particularistic interests of outwardly (inwardly) oriented elites more than democracies do through weak-currency/large-reserve (strong-currency/small-reserve) policies. Utilizing panel data covering 127 countries from 1975 to 2012, I find that more democratic regimes are associated with larger (smaller) volumes of reserves when the size of exporting sectors is considerably small (large).","tags":null,"title":"Democracy and Reserves","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nisha Bellinger","Byunghwan Son"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1569283200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1569283200,"objectID":"314695aec74cd8a782beb6b87dd420e0","permalink":"https://academic-demo.netlify.app/publication/bellinger2019/","publishdate":"2019-09-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/bellinger2019/","section":"publication","summary":"This article focuses on the nature of party systems to explain variations in foreign direct investment inflows within developing democracies. We hypothesize a positive relationship between the effective number of parliamentary parties and foreign direct investment inflows. Large effective number of parliamentary parties is indicative of the expropriation risks as well as stability of the political environment of host countries. We thus argue that expropriation risks are low when the presence of multiple parties makes drastic, impulsive changes in economic policies difficult. We also suggest that a larger number of parties represent diverse societal interests better, reducing the chances of underrepresented social groups driving political instability. The relationship between effective number of parliamentary party and foreign direct investment inflows is tested on a sample of 56 developing democracies from 1985 to 2011.

The paper demonstrates why this expectation did not materialize and instead an unprecedentedly large degree of overvaluation took place. Focusing on three variables, namely, financial repression, devaluation pass-through, and policy exhibitionism, the paper examines how the unraveling of the developmental state eventually gave rise to the 1990s‚Äô overvaluation. It argues that the policy exhibitionism of the new civilian government amplified the influence of Chaebol on monetary policies, which in turn created a strong appreciative force to KRW. It also contends that the increasing exchange rate pass-through onto the prices of imported intermediate goods explains why Chaebol did not desire to tame the excessive appreciative trend despite its detrimental effect on their exports. The paper offers policy implications for other state-led, emerging economies.","tags":null,"title":"The mysterious overvaluation of KRW in the 1990s","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Byunghwan Son","Jonathan Krieckhaus"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1526256000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1526256000,"objectID":"58030b05bcf6d1e539b3195341b231ba","permalink":"https://academic-demo.netlify.app/publication/son2018a/","publishdate":"2018-05-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/son2018a/","section":"publication","summary":"Latin America experienced a deep political transformation from authoritarianism to democracy in the recent decades. During the same period, many countries in the region also suffered severe currency crises. We contend that these two phenomena are causally related. Specifically, we argue that democratic transitions increase political demand for public spending, leading to budget deficits, and this increases investors‚Äô propensity to liquidate local currency holdings. Moreover, we note an important ‚Äòthreshold‚Äô effect, in which democratisation is particularly likely to lead to currency crises when the pre-existing fiscal deficits are already relatively high.

This paper attempts to answer this question by studying the relationship between democratization and currency devaluation under speculative pressures. The central argument is that young democracies exhibit relatively high probabilities of succumbing to speculative attacks, as the political cost of economic adjustment needed for defense is relatively high for these nascent regimes. The paper further contends that this relationship is stronger when the regime can mobilize fewer resources to defend their currencies. To test these arguments, this paper uses monthly data for 117 countries from 1975 to 2008. The results from statistical analysis provide corroborative evidence for these arguments.","tags":null,"title":"Policy choices in tough times: The case of democratization and currency defense","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Byunghwan Son"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1464739200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1464739200,"objectID":"63227ba6d0482920f1ae88e33136f2ac","permalink":"https://academic-demo.netlify.app/publication/son2016b/","publishdate":"2016-06-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/son2016b/","section":"publication","summary":"Extant literature on democratization documents that ordinary citizens‚Äô unconditional support for democracy is indispensable to democratic consolidation. Yet observers of nascent democracies have repeatedly witnessed that such support often hinges upon their economic conditions. This paper argues that income levels have a conditioning effect on this relationship; the Korean poor see democracy as a tool for income redistribution and are less likely than the rich to support it when economic hardships appear to close windows of opportunities for such redistribution. Using survey data from the first round of the Asian Barometer Survey on South Korea, I find strong empirical support for this argument. The implication of this finding for broader literature on democratization is that the weakening of young democracies can be attributed to the poor in times of trouble, or the ‚Äúweak link‚Äù.","tags":null,"title":"Are the Poor the Weak Link?

Synthesizing insights from the currency crisis literature with sanctions scholarship, we argue that economic sanctions are likely to trigger currency collapses, a major form of financial crisis that impedes economic growth and prosperity. We assert that economic coercion instigates currency crises by weakening the economy and creating political risks conducive to speculative attacks by currency traders. To substantiate the theoretical claims, we use time-series cross-national data for the 1970‚Äì2005 period. The results from the data analysis lend support for the hypothesis that sanctions undermine the financial stability of target countries. The findings also indicate that the adverse effect of economic coercion on the financial stability of target economies is likely to be conditioned by the severity of the coercion and the type of actors involved in the implementation of sanctions. The findings of this article add to the sanctions literature demonstrating how economic coercion could be detrimental to the target economy beyond the immediate effect on trade and investment. It also complements and adds to the literature on political economy of currency crises that has so far overlooked the significant role that economic coercion plays in financial crises.","tags":null,"title":"Economic Coercion and Currency Crises in Target Countries","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Krieckhaus Jonathan","Byunghwan Son","Nisha Bellinger","Jason M.

Political economy theory suggests that in a country with high inequality the majority of the population will support democracy as a potential mechanism for redistribution. Much of the survey and area-studies literature, by contrast, suggests that inequality generates political disillusion and regime dissatisfaction. To clarify this disagreement we distinguish between prospective versus retrospective evaluations as well as between egocentric versus sociotropic evaluations. We test the resulting hypotheses in a multi-level analysis conducted in 40 democracies. We find that citizens are retrospective and sociotropic, meaning that higher levels of economic inequality reduce support for democracy amongst all social classes. We also find a small prospective egocentric effect, in that the reduction in democratic support in highly unequal countries is slightly less severe amongst the poor, suggesting they believe that democracy might increase future redistribution.","tags":null,"title":"Economic Inequality and Democratic Support","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"f26b5133c34eec1aa0a09390a36c2ade","permalink":"https://academic-demo.netlify.app/admin/config.yml","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/admin/config.yml","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"wowchemycms"}]
